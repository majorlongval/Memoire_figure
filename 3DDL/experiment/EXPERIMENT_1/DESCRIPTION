THIS EXPERIMENT HAD THE CM DISPLACED FROM THE CENTRE.

The givens were the following : height was at 2 m from the motors.

The added mass weight was 329.7 g and was added to the radius of the WS

The end effector mass us 523 g and my cell phone is 174.1 g

the ratio of the cm was: 329.7*0.2/(329.7+174.1+523)

the experiment went to 90 % of the total WS.
