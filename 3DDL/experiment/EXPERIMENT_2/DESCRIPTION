THIS EXPERIMENT HAD FORCES APPLIED LATTERALY ON THE ROBOT

The givens were the following : height was at 2 m from the motors and at 2.5 m from the motors.

The forces added on the y axis were +- 3.69 N

total mass of the end effector with cell phone (2.429 kg) (This was applied at the centre of mass)

the experiment went to 90 % of the total WS.

Forces were applied alternatively at each point on two different heights.
